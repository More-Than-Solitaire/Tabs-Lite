## <a name="infocollect"></a> 1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?
<strong><h3>Personal information you disclose to us</h3></strong><strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><strong><em> </em></strong><em>We collect personal information that you provide to us.</em> 
We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us. 
<strong>Sensitive Information.</strong> We do not process sensitive information. 
All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information. 

## <a name="infouse"></a> 2. HOW DO WE PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
<strong><em>In Short: </em></strong><em>We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We process the personal information for the following purposes listed below. We may also process your information for other purposes only with your prior explicit consent.</em> 
<strong>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</strong>  

 - <strong>To save or protect an individual's vital interest.</strong> We may process your information when necessary to save or protect an individual’s vital interest, such as to prevent harm. 

## <a name="legalbases"></a> 3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?
<em><strong>In Short: </strong>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</em> 
<em><strong><u>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</u></strong></em> 
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:

 - <strong>Consent. </strong>We may process your information if you have given us permission (i.e., consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more about <a data-custom-class="link" href="#withdrawconsent">withdrawing your consent</a>.  

 - <strong>Legal Obligations.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.   

 - <strong>Vital Interests.</strong> We may process your information where we believe it is necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person. 

<strong><u><em>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</em></u></strong> 
We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can <a data-custom-class="link" href="#withdrawconsent">withdraw your consent</a> at any time. 
In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:

 - If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way 

 - For investigations and fraud detection and prevention 

 - For business transactions provided certain conditions are met 

 - If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim 

 - For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin 

 - If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse 

 - If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province 

 - If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records 

 - If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced 

 - If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes 

 - If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations 

 - We may disclose de-identified information for approved research or statistics projects, subject to ethics oversight and confidentiality commitments 

## <a name="whoshare"></a> 4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?
<strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.</em> 
We may need to share your personal information in the following situations:

 - <strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.      

## <a name="inforetain"></a> 5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
<strong><em>In Short: </em></strong><em>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em> 
We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). 
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible. 

## <a name="infominors"></a> 6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?
<strong><em>In Short:</em></strong><em> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction.</em> 
We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.

## <a name="DNT"></a> 8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice. 
California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
